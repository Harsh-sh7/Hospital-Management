# Hospital Management System

This project was built using Python and MySQL by me and my friend during our high school days. The **Hospital Management System (CHMS)** is designed to help manage patient registrations, appointments with doctors, and doctor data.

## Features

### Patient
- **Register a patient**: Allows new patients to enter their details (Aadhaar number, name, age, gender, phone number, blood group).
- **Make an appointment with a doctor**: Patients can book appointments based on available doctors in various departments.
- **Modify the data of an existing patient**: Patients can update their details such as name, age, phone, gender, etc.
- **List the doctors available**: Displays a list of doctors with their specializations and available room numbers.

### Doctors
- **Sign in as a doctor**: Requires an ID number and password for authentication.
- **View patient appointments**: Doctors can check the list of patients appointed to them for the day or upcoming days.

## Run Locally
